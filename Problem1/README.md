Given an expression string exp, examine whether the pairs and the orders of 
"{", "}", "(", ")", "[", "]" are correct in exp.

For example, the program should return `true` for `[()]{}{[()()]()}` and `false` for `[(])`.

Please check provided test cases to see expected behaviour for different inputs.
